/**
 * Composite mutation that:
 *   1. mints a client-side `tuiAgentId` so the same id can be used
 *      everywhere (binding row, agent.tui.prepareLaunch, persisted
 *      record),
 *   2. opens a canvas tab placeholder for the client-minted id BEFORE
 *      worktree creation and `agent.tui.prepareLaunch` for normal launches so
 *      the user has a visible tui-agent surface inside the Epic while
 *      worktree creation and launch preparation run. Fork launches
 *      intentionally wait until `agent.tui.prepareLaunch` returns the new
 *      forked session so the tab opens on the forked session rather than a
 *      pre-fork placeholder. The tile renders "Loading terminal agent…" until
 *      the persisted record lands (or the user closes the tab), so a slow
 *      worktree creation or launch preparation cannot strand the user without
 *      a placeholder/recovery surface in the Epic context.
 *   3. for Worktree-mode launches, dispatches the matching `worktree.*`
 *      RPC so the host SQLite binding row exists before the harness
 *      preparation reads it,
 *   4. prepares a tui-agent session via `agent.tui.prepareLaunch`
 *      which seeds a default owner-scoped binding from the epic's folders
 *      when none was dispatched in step 3 (the always-non-empty seam),
 *      rejects with `WORKTREE_MISSING` if a bound folder is gone on disk
 *      (no silent demote); the worktree setup script keeps running in its
 *      background terminal and never gates the launch,
 *   5. inserts a tui-agent record via `epic.createTuiAgent`
 *      with the client-minted id (the Y.Doc projection swaps the
 *      placeholder out for the real record).
 *
 * Errors from any step propagate; the underlying TanStack Query mutations'
 * default toasts surface user-facing messaging. A missing bound folder
 * (`WORKTREE_MISSING`) surfaces as a typed error from
 * `agent.tui.prepareLaunch`; when it fires the harness never starts and the
 * persisted record is never written. Setup-script failure / cancellation is
 * NOT a launch error - the launch is non-blocking and the tile's setup card
 * owns that UX (progress, Open terminal, Retry). Normal launches keep the
 * placeholder canvas tab visible as the durable recovery surface alongside
 * the typed error (and, for `WORKTREE_MISSING`, the tui-agent tile's own
 * restore/retry body). Fork launches do not open the placeholder until the
 * forked session is ready.
 *
 * Orphan-binding boundary (be precise — these two paths differ):
 *   - DEFAULT (null intent): no binding is written until prepareLaunch's seam
 *     runs, and the resolver preflights the missing-check BEFORE that seam write,
 *     so a rejected default-seed launch persists NO binding row. Orphan-safe.
 *   - EXPLICIT intent: step 3's `worktree.create` persists the binding BEFORE
 *     prepareLaunch, so a prepareLaunch rejection (e.g. `WORKTREE_MISSING`)
 *     after that write leaves a binding row for an owner id that never gets
 *     a record. This orphan window is
 *     inherent to this deliberately non-atomic 3-step flow (kept for the
 *     placeholder-during-setup UX; a single atomic create RPC would close it) and
 *     is PRE-EXISTING, not introduced by the missing-worktree work. The retained
 *     background audit (`workspaceBinding.removeEntry`) does not reap it; closing
 *     it is a separate atomic-create / orphan-reaper follow-up.
