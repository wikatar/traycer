/**
 * Decides whether steering a queued prompt into the running turn can fold in
 * silently or must interrupt and restart the turn under new settings.
 *
 * The comparison set is kept in lockstep with the host's
 * `queuedSettingsMatchActiveExecution`: harness, model, reasoning effort,
 * service tier, and profileId are baked into turn/thread start, so changing
 * any of them can't apply to a turn already in flight - a
 * differently-profiled prompt would otherwise fold into the running turn's
 * provider process and deliver under the wrong account. permissionMode is
 * excluded - it applies softly to the next turn, so a permission-only change
 * still injects at a safe point. The host derives provider-session fork policy
 * from the accepted settings; this function is renderer-only confirmation
 * policy.
 *
 * `activeTurn.profileId` defaults to `null` (ambient) for a turn received from
 * a host, or read from persisted state, before this field existed. During that
 * skew window this can under-report the turn's real profile, but never
 * over-reports it as a match: a `null` default only compares equal to a
 * currently-ambient selection, so the worst case is an unnecessary restart
 * confirmation for a same-profile continuation, never a silent fold-in under
 * the wrong profile. Same safe-direction tradeoff the other baked-in fields
 * already accept implicitly.
 *
 * `changed` lists human-readable labels for the differing settings, for the
 * confirm dialog copy.
