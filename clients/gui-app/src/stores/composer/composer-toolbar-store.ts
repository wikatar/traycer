/**
 * Per-composer toolbar state (model/permission/reasoning/tier).
 *
 * One store instance is created per composer surface (held in `useState`,
 * mirroring `createComposerPickerStore`), so toggling model / provider /
 * reasoning for one chat never leaks into another. Toolbar leaves subscribe
 * to the derived slices they render; submit paths read `store.getState()` -
 * the sanctioned escape hatch - so the host composer component does not
 * re-render on toolbar changes at all.
 *
 * The store keeps two layers:
 *
 * - `values`: the RAW sticky values exactly as seeded/user-picked. They are
 *   never clamped, so a preference survives a harness/model round-trip.
 * - derived top-level fields (`selection`, `permission`, `reasoning`,
 *   `selectedModel`, `supportedPermissionModes`, ...): the resolved values
 *   the UI shows and the emit path sends. Recomputed by every action from
 *   `values` + `catalog`, with reference-preservation so unchanged slices
 *   don't wake subscribers.
 *
 * Catalog data (harness availability + the selected harness's models) is
 * TanStack Query state pushed in via `setCatalog` by
 * `useComposerToolbarStore`; this store never fetches.
