/**
 * D4 (durability audit): "Fork dialog seeded from a chat whose profile is now
 * tombstoned: falls back to ambient for the new selection; no crash."
 *
 * `ComposerToolbarCatalog` (composer-toolbar-store.ts) only ever carries
 * `harnesses` + a harness's `models` - it never receives `profiles[]`, so
 * `deriveToolbarState` / `effectiveSelectionFromHarnesses` have no way to
 * know whether a seeded `profileId` still exists, and this file confirms
 * that stays true (the store presents a stale seed as fully resolved and
 * catalog-confirmed, with no crash).
 *
 * FIX LANDED at the CALLER boundary instead of here: threading `profiles[]`
 * into this shared catalog would touch every composer surface (main chat
 * composer, both fork dialogs, add-node, landing composer, ...) for a defect
 * that - per the audit - only bites fork dialogs (the main composer already
 * has `useProviderReauthGate` blocking send on a missing profile). Each fork
 * dialog now validates its OWN seed against live `providers.list` profiles
 * BEFORE handing it to this store (`resolveSeededProfileId` +
 * chat-fork-dialog.tsx / terminal-agent-fork-dialog.tsx) - see
 * `profile-durability-d4-terminal-fork-tombstoned.test.tsx` for the
 * passing end-to-end coverage. This file documents the resulting
 * architectural boundary: the store trusts its seed verbatim; the caller is
 * responsible for handing it a live one.
